## ⚙️ Data Preparation

Steps followed to **clean and enrich the data** before visualization:

1. 📥 **Loaded Excel data** into **PostgreSQL** using SQL queries.
2. 🔗 Connected **PostgreSQL to Power BI Desktop** and imported datasets.
3. 🧮 Created calculated **columns & measures** in Power BI:

   ```DAX
   -- Revenue Calculation
   Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] 
           + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] 
           + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Week Number
   week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Current Week Revenue
   Current_week_revenue =
   CALCULATE(
       SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
       FILTER(ALL('public cc_detail'),
       'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]))
   )
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Previous Week Revenue
   Previous_week_revenue =
   CALCULATE(
       SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
       FILTER(ALL('public cc_detail'),
       'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]) - 1)
   )
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Week-on-Week Revenue Change
   WOW_revenue =
   DIVIDE(([Current_week_revenue] - [Previous_week_revenue]), [Previous_week_revenue])
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Age Group Buckets
   AgeGroup = SWITCH(
       TRUE(),
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
       'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
       "unknown"
   )
   ```

   ```DAX
   -- Income Group Buckets
   IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
       TRUE(),
       'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
       'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] < 70000, "Medium",
       'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
       "unknown"
   )
   ```
